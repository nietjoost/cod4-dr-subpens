The "Deathrun" mod for Call of Duty 4 is an exhilarating and dynamic multiplayer game mode that adds a thrilling twist to the classic first-person shooter experience. In this custom game mode, players are divided into two teams: the "Runners" and the "Death." The Runners must navigate through a series of deadly traps, obstacles, and challenges set up by the Death team, while attempting to reach the end of the map unscathed. The Death team, on the other hand, takes on the role of trap-setters, aiming to strategically deploy hazards and utilize their weapons to eliminate the Runners before they complete the course.

The mod's gameplay encourages teamwork, coordination, and quick thinking, as Runners need to communicate effectively to overcome the challenging obstacles while avoiding enemy fire and traps. Each map in the Deathrun mod is uniquely designed, offering a variety of obstacles and surprises to keep players on their toes.
